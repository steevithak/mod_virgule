Installation of mod_virgule should be relatively easy. You need a
development setup for Apache (the RedHat apache-dev RPM should
suffice), as well as glib and gnome-xml.

The Makefile is designed to use config binaries, in particular
/usr/sbin/apxs for Apache, and gnome-config for glib and gnome-xml.
Note that Debian has apxs in /usr/bin; you'll need to fiddle with the
Makefile. Also, Debian apxs wants -ldbm instead of -lgdbm. Builder
beware!

On my RH 6.0 box, "make install" has paths set up wrongly (this is a
bug in the RH apxs config). You have a few choices. One is to install
by hand. I just have the httpd.conf file point to the build dir.

This is what I added to my httpd.conf:

LoadModule virgule_module     /home/raph/golf/apache/virgule/mod_virgule.so
AddModule mod_virgule.c

<VirtualHost www.advogato.org>
 VirguleDb /home/raph/advogato.org
</VirtualHost>

It doesn't have to be in a virtualhost, it can be toplevel or in a
<Location>. Putting it in a <Directory> probably won't work at the
moment, because virgule messes around with the translation stuff.

Virgule works out of a database. The pathname is set in the VirguleDb
directive. Within that directory you'll have a bunch of
subdirectories:

* acct/ stores account info, one subdir per account
* site/ stores static pages
* articles/ stores the articles
* recent/ stores some recent stuff
* tmetric/ stores the tmetric cache

You'll need to have rw permissions for nobody set for the virgule db.
It's probably easiest to just create it with owner nobody.

Static files are stored in the site/ subdir as foo.xml. Thus, the url
/foo/bar.html is stored as site/foo/bar.xml. The default is index.xml.

I should probably package up a database with skeletal static pages,
but it's not too hard to figure out.

The sample_db/ subdirectory in this distribution contains a snapshot
of xml files from advogato. You'll no doubt want to customize them.
See site.c for more information on the xml tags.

Finally, I have a cron job to regularly access /tmetric/, which
refreshes the tmetric cache.

Have fun!
