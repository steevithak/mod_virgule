------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Install apache, glib, and libxml2 dev packages

2. Uncomment appropriate makefile options for Apache APR and gcc

3. Build mod_virgule, typing "make" should do it

4. Move mod_virgule.so to your Apache modules directory

5. Add module directive to your httpd.conf file:

  LoadModule virgule_module modules/mod_virgule.so
  
6. Add VirguleDB and VirgulePass directives to httpd.conf:

<VirtualHost 1.2.3.4:80>
    ServerName mysite.com
    DocumentRoot /var/www/mysite.com
    ...
    VirguleDB /var/www/mysite.com
    VirgulePass "/images" "/css"
</VirtualHost>

7. Copy the content of /sample_db to your VirguleDB directory

8. Make sure the VirguleDB directory is owned by and writable by the
Apache user (e.g. httpd, nobody, or whatever is used on your distro).

9. Restart apache

10. Hit the site with a browser and see if it works

11. Edit the site/config.xml file as desired for your site

12. Edit the CSS, images, and XML templates as desired for your site

Notes:

You should be able to run two or more completely different mod_virgule sites
on the same server. I have run as many as four sites on the same server with
no problems. 

Normally the Virgule directive go inside <VirtualHost> but you can try 
using them in <Location> as well - this should work in theory at least.
<Directory> probably will not work because mod_virgule needs to do
translations - if you try it, please report your results. :)

VirguleDb specifies the directory used by mod_virgule to keep its XML
database. Normally, this is the same as the site's document root and the
VirgulePass directive specifies any paths that need to be handled as
static paths by Apache rather than dymanically by mod_virgule.

If you run into problems or notice incompatibilities with the makefile
on your distro, please post to the mod_virgule development mailing list.
Also post any patches you come up with that fix the build on your distro.

Here's a breakdown of what the directories in the sample_db are for:

acct - account XML DB, one subdir per account
articles - article XML DB, one subdir per article
css - static css files used by the site's HTML
data - Stores the line delimited Wiki intermap
eigen - diary (blog) eigenvector trust metric cache
images - static images used by the site's HTML
proj - project XML DB, one subdir per project
recent - XML DB of recent activity
site - XML pages that make up the site ( /index.html = /site/index.xml )
templates - XML templates for dynamic pages (e.g. profile, articles)
tmetric - trust metric cache

Admin functionality 

There are several special URLs used to administer and maintain the mod_virgule
site. These are group under the /admin/ URL, which should be password
protected in your httpd.conf file for security. The first three admin URLs
should be hit by a cronjob at regular intervals to keep things running. The
last three URLs are intended to run manually by the site administrator only
if needed.

 /admin/crank-tmetric.html - should be hit by cronjob to update trust
 /admin/crank-diaryrating.html - should be hit by cronjob to update ratings
 /admin/crank-aggregator.html - should be hit by cronjob to update aggregator

 /admin/articlemaint.html - rebuilds per-user article indices
 /admin/clean-diaryratings.html - remove refs to deleted accounts
 /admin/acctmaint.html - repairs damaged account profiles and trust certs
