This is mod_virgule, the source code to Advogato,
http://www.advogato.org/ . I am releasing it under GPL with the hope
that members of the free software community will:

* Enhance Advogato.

* Develop mod_virgule as a generic tool for creating community web
  sites.

* Learn from mod_virgule's design and implementation, which is unusual
  in a number of respects.

mod_virgule is implemented as an Apache C module, using gnome-xml to
store the state as a XML files in the filesystem. There is an
abstraction layer, however, which means that using a different backend
(such as a "real" database) should be possible.

Right now, there's quite a bit of stuff in the C code that's specific
to Advogato. A medium-term goal is to push most of that stuff into the
XML, so the code itself is more generic. There are a fair number of
core changes here, so it's probably not a good place to hack in
without coordinating with me.

Development continues slowly. There's a new canonical home for
mod_virgule in ghostscript cvs. You can access it thus:

cvs -z3 -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.ghostscript.com:/cvs/mod_virgule login
[just press 'enter' if asked for a password]
cvs -z3 -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.ghostscript.com:/cvs/mod_virgule \
	checkout mod_virgule

There's also a discussion mailing list (virgule-dev) hosted at zork.net.
You can sign up in the usual way, or visit the web interface at

Happy Hacking,
