 <title>Create new account</title>

  <p> Use this form to create a new account. </p>

  <h2> Should you have an account? </h2>

  <p> If you have contributed in some way to free software (i.e. if
  you feel you can get <a href="../certs.html">certified</a> to at
  least Apprentice level), the answer is yes. If you just use free
  software, then an account won't really help you that much. </p>

  <p> Right now, the main thing an account buys you is the ability to
  certify and be certified. Soon, being certified will grant you
  privileges to post to the news flow. It's also plausible that down
  the line, being certified will bring other benefits. </p>

  <p> And in the meantime, it's fun! So if you are a free software
  developer, go ahead and sign up: </p>

  <form method="POST" action="newsub.html">
   <p> User name: <br/>
    <input name="u" size="20"/> 
   </p>
   <p> Passphrase: <br/>
    <input name="pass" size="20" type="password"/> 
   </p>
   <p> Passphrase again: <br/>
    <input name="pass2" size="20" type="password"/> 
   </p>
   <p> Also, it would be very helpful to get some information about
   you: </p>
   <p> Your given (first) name: <br/>
    <input name="givenname" size="40"/> 
   </p>
   <p> Your surname (last name): <br/>
    <input name="surname" size="40"/> 
   </p>
   <p> Surname first?
    <input type="checkbox" name="sf"/> 
   </p>
   <p> Your e-mail (will be kept private): <br/>
    <input name="email" size="40"/> 
   </p>
   <p> Your homepage: <br/>
    <input name="url" size="40"/> 
   </p>
   <p> Notes: <br/>
    <textarea name="notes" cols="60" rows="15" wrap="hard"/>
   </p>
   <input type="submit" value="Create"/>
